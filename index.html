  <!-- Section 1 - Introduction -->
  <section id="section1">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Before diving into the components of the email validation regular expression, it's essential to understand the need for such patterns. In web development, validating user input, especially email addresses, is a common task. This tutorial will guide you through creating a regex for this purpose.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Section 2 - Component 1 - Username -->
  <section id="section2">
    <h2>Component 1 - Username</h2>
    <p>The username is the first part of an email address. It allows for alphanumeric characters (both uppercase and lowercase) and underscores. The regular expression for the username component is <code>[a-zA-Z0-9_]+</code>. This means one or more characters that are either letters (both cases), digits, or underscores.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Section 3 - Component 2 - @ Symbol -->
  <section id="section3">
    <h2>Component 2 - @ Symbol</h2>
    <p>The @ symbol is a mandatory separator between the username and the domain in an email address. In the regular expression, simply including the @ symbol ensures its presence. The regular expression snippet is <code>@</code>.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Section 4 - Component 3 - Domain -->
  <section id="section4">
    <h2>Component 3 - Domain</h2>
    <p>The domain is the second part of an email address, following the @ symbol. It allows for alphanumeric characters (both uppercase and lowercase) and hyphens. The regular expression for the domain component is <code>[a-zA-Z0-9-]+</code>. This means one or more characters that are either letters (both cases), digits, or hyphens.</p>

  <!-- Section 5 - Conclusion -->
  <section id="section5">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Congratulations! You've successfully learned the components of a basic email validation regular expression. Regular expressions are powerful tools in your programming arsenal, and understanding them will greatly enhance your ability to handle and validate user input.
